JavaScript - Form Validation
avaScript provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.

Basic Validation − First of all, the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in.
It would require just a loop through each field in the form and check for data.

Data Format Validation − Secondly, the data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. 
Our code must include appropriate logic to test correctness of data.

JavaScript - Animation
We can use JavaScript to create a complex animation having, but not limited to, the following elements −

-Fireworks
-Fade Effect
-Roll-in or Roll-out
-Page-in or Page-out
-Object movements

JavaScript provides the following two functions to be frequently used in animation programs.

-setTimeout( function, duration) − This function calls function after duration milliseconds from now.
-setInterval(function, duration) − This function calls function after every duration milliseconds.
-clearTimeout(setTimeout_variable) − This function calls clears any timer set by the setTimeout() functions.

JavaScript - Multimedia
The JavaScript navigator object includes a child object called plugins. This object is an array,
with one entry for each plug-in installed on the browser. The navigator.plugins object is supported only by Netscape,
Firefox, and Mozilla only.

Checking for Plug-Ins
Each plug-in has an entry in the array. Each entry has the following properties −
->name − is the name of the plug-in.
->filename − is the executable file that was loaded to install the plug-in.
->description − is a description of the plug-in, supplied by the developer.
->mimeTypes − is an array with one entry for each MIME type supported by the plug-in.

JavaScript - Debugging
The process of finding and fixing bugs is called debugging and is a normal part of the development process.
This section covers tools and techniques that can help you with debugging tasks.

Error Messages in Firefox or Mozilla
Other browsers like Firefox, Netscape, and Mozilla send error messages to a special window called the JavaScript
Console or Error Consol. To view the console, select Tools → Error Consol or Web Development.

Unfortunately, since these browsers give no visual indication when an error occurs, you must keep the Console open and
watch for errors as your script executes.

Error Notifications
Error notifications that show up on Console or through Internet Explorer dialog boxes are the result of both syntax and 
runtime errors. These error notification include the line number at which the error occurred.

If you are using Firefox, then you can click on the error available in the error console to go to the exact line in the 
script having error.

code for debugger-
var debugging = true;
var whichImage = "widget";
if( debugging )
   alert( "Calls swapImage() with argument: " + whichImage );
   var swapStatus = swapImage( whichImage );
if( debugging )
   alert( "Exits swapImage() with swapStatus=" + swapStatus );
